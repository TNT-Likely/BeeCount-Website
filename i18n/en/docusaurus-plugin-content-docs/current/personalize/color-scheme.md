# Income/Expense Color Scheme

Customize income and expense display colors to adapt to different regional reading habits.

## Why Switch Color Schemes?

Different regions have different color associations:

- **Red for Income · Green for Expense** - Traditional Chinese preference, red represents celebration and gain
- **Red for Expense · Green for Income** - International standard, red represents warning and outflow

## Change Color Scheme

1. Go to "Mine" → "Appearance Settings" → "Personalization"
2. Tap "Income/Expense Color Scheme"
3. Select your preferred scheme

## Color Scheme Options

### Red for Expense · Green for Income

## Application Scope
